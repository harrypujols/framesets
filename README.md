The Frameset Boilerplate
========================

*Because the 90s were frikkin' awesome!* :fax:

## FAQs

- **Q- WTF, bro.**
    - A- Did you know that there's a frikkin doctype for framesets? No, [really](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp), and just to save you the trouble to click to another site, it's `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`
- **Q- Why do you want to bring this shit back to life? It should be dead where it belongs.**
    - A- I believe this method should be documented in Github with many comments, and guides. Not to revive it, but for, ahem, historical documentation purposes.
- **Q- Are you going to make this intentionally lame and/or funny?**
    - Nah. I think it can be lame on its own merits. But I want to use the best technology available in 1999 to complete this project.
- **Q- Are you going to lay it out with tables and outdated tags?**
    - Probably. I don't know if I will use tags like `<marquee>` or `<blink>`. Framesets are aceptable in some kind of HTML4 flavor, so I have to study what is legal and what isn't.
- **Q- Are you going to use modern tools like jQuery or Normalizr?**
    - Probably. As long as the final product remains within its original educational purpose.
    - The only rule I got for this boilerplate is that it has to be compatible with all browsers available in late 1999.
- **Q- Can I help?**
    - Sure. Fork it and let me see what you got.
    - One thing I will like to do is to collect infamous gifs from the late 90s. If you can help, you are welcome to join the fun.
